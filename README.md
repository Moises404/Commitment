Commitment
=================

Github commit drawing mechanism started as an experiement at the School for Poetic Computation. The code is written in bash which automates a series of commit timestamps that affect the visual look of the users github. Project done in collaboration with Jonathan Wohl.

Application
=================

In order to make the code function the user must create their own repo and execute the code from their personal account. Forked repos don't affect the commit timestamp of the user. Also beware the affects that these commits create for your timeline.
